# Password_Generator
 A tool to create a randomized password

## What this project is
This is a simple application that will generate a random password based on user-selected criteria.

_**Warning:** This is for demonstration purposes only. Using the generated password is not advised as the page and source are not encrypted._

## Why I began this project
I wanted to test my knowledge of basic JavaScript and utilizing the ```Math.random()``` function to randomize results.

## How I implemented this project
This project was implemented by featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by JavaScript code.

## What I hope to eventually accomplish with this project
I would like to add a 'Copy to Clipboard' button that appears once the password has been generated. Maybe even taking place of the original button until the page is refreshed.
